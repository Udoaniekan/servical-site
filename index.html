    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p><strong>Servicall</strong> is a mobile-first web application designed to bridge the gap between individuals and trusted local artisans â€” such as electricians, plumbers, mechanics, and groomers. In under 30 seconds, users can find, book, and track skilled service providers in real-time.</p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Most people struggle to find reliable artisans quickly. Meanwhile, skilled professionals lack visibility and digital tools to manage their work. Thereâ€™s no fast, verified, centralized system built specifically for this market â€” until now.</p>
